  title: "Senior Human Resources Manager",
  about: `I'm a senior HR professional with over 7 years of experience driving organizational transformation and building comprehensive HR infrastructure. My expertise spans the entire HR spectrum, from strategic talent management to compliance and HRIS implementation.

I specialize in manufacturing environments and defense contracting, with a proven track record of establishing HR functions from the ground up and modernizing existing operations. My approach combines deep HR knowledge with business acumen to create sustainable, scalable solutions.

What sets me apart is my ability to bridge the gap between HR strategy and business outcomes. I don't just manage HR processesâ€”I build systems that drive organizational success. Whether it's implementing comprehensive compliance frameworks, designing compensation structures, or leading digital transformation initiatives, I bring a strategic perspective to every challenge.`,
